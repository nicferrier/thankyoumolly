        Molly,
      </p>
      <p>
        Hope you are feeling better.

        You've taught us important things about the Web: about HTML, CSS,
        accessibility, browsers. It's hard to overestimate the number of us
        whose lives you have affected with your writing, your advocacy, your
        enthusiasm and your kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone who has met you can't help but like you. This is just to say,
        we're thinking about you.

        You are one of the few people who treats everyone you meet, no matter
        how much of a noob they are when you first meet them, with love and
        kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
        You make the Web better by being here.

       <p>You and I have never met. But I've read stuff you've written and I've benefitted from it. It is good. 
       That's enough for me to say Thank You. So: Thank you.</p>
